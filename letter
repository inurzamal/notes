Subject: Request for UAT Database Encryption Evidence

Hi Aaron,

I hope you're doing well. We require evidence that the databases in our non-production environment are encrypted. Specifically, could you please provide evidence that the UAT cluster for our database servers (dan:6800) is encrypted?

"Your help is greatly appreciated."
